# Learning Go Through Pluralsight

## Why Go?
- Why Create Go
    - Created within Google
    - Go has efficient compilation, efficient execution and ease of programming
- Guiding Principles
    - Simplicity as a core value
    - Commitment to backward compatibility
    - Made for concurrent, network enabled applications
    - Holistic approach to solve common problems
- Language Characteristics
    - Strong static type system
    - C-inspired syntax
    - Garbage collected
    - Fully compiled
    - Rapid compilation
    - Single binary output
    - Cross platform
- Primary Use Cases
    - Used for cloud and network services
    - Used for command-line interfaces
    - Used for Cloud infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform)
## Programming with Go
- Language Characteristics and Evolution
    - Starts with C programming language
    - Modern C (Faster computers, Multiple CPUs, Network aware)
- Demo: Hello, World
    - See hello_world.go file for code.
    - Everything in go is contained within packages
    - Create Entry point (func main() {})
    - Package fmt to print strings
    - "go run (name of file)" to run and see result
- Demo: A Simple Web Service
    - Writers are interfaces that can be written to.
- Demo: CLI Application
    - flag package strongly type command line paramaters as flags
    - "*" is a pointer
## Leveraging the Go Ecosystem
- Development Tools
    - VScode, Goland, Vim, Emacs, Eclipse
    - Gopls unifies the tools
- Common Frameworks
    - Go Kit (Comprehensive microservice framework)
    - Gin (Fast, lightweight web framework)
    - Gorilla Toolkit (Collection of useful tools without framework lock-in)
    - Cobra (Framework for building command-line interface applications)
    - Standard library (Zero dependency APIs for managing simple CLIs)
    - Docker (Containerize applications to simplify deployment)
    - Kubernetes (System that builds, deploys and scales containerized apps)
    - Terraform (Cloud infrastructure management platform)
